Important Note:
ðŸš¨ This website is NOT responsive. It is designed for desktop screens only and does not include media queries for mobile or tablet support.

This is my first project uploaded to GitHub, and it demonstrates my skills in front-end development and JavaScript interactivity. Future improvements may include adding responsiveness, optimizing UI/UX, and integrating a backend for real transactions.
